If the hypothesis is worth testing, it generates a full experiment plan: protocol with citations, materials with verified catalog numbers from real vendors, equipment lists, a budget breakdown, a timeline, and a validation approach. Every claim gets a confidence score so you know what the AI is certain about and where it is guessing.",

Phase 3 re-verifies every catalog number against live sources and annotates confidence scores.
